When Player Hit:
-Disable Character Controller
-Disable Animation
-Enable Rigidbody(To enable Ragdoll components)

When Player not Hit:
-Enable Character Controller
-Enable Animation
-Disable Rigidbody(if we disable Rigidbody the Ragdoll Components wont)

P.S The Ragdoll will only work when animation is disabled, if Animation is Enabled 
    then the character will be back to normal. Dont Enable the Character Controller 
    when Rigidbody is Enabled, Character controller is for Player controls and Rigidbody 
    is for Ragdoll. Character Controller is same with rigidbody but for controlling the 
    player.
